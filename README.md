# Simple-Raytracing
This an assignment of DISM (Dispositivos e Infraestructuras de Sistemas Multimedia) of a raytracer using CUDA acceleration, following the Peter Shirley book (https://github.com/petershirley/raytracinginoneweekend), and making, or at least trying to make, my own CUDA implementation.

In the doc folder, you can see and read (IN SPANISH) the actual document I wrote.

## Information
To make this project I used
  - Cuda Toolkit 10.0
  - Visual Studio 2017
  - GLM

Furthermore, my poor GPU is a Nvidia GTX 660 (CC 3.0), so if you want to take advantage of a major compute capability, you must change compilation options.

## How to execute
  - Open the VS 2017 project folder
  - Compile and let the magic begin
  
## To do in the future:
This assignment is not fully finished, and IS NOT WORKING TOTALLY.
In the future I would like to finish it, but for now, I have to put it aside.
